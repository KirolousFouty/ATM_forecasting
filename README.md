## Description:
In this innovative project, I leveraged advanced data generation and simulation techniques to model the cash flow dynamics of ATMs, focusing on daily balance fluctuations and withdrawal patterns. By simulating realistic scenarios of ATM operations, I created a comprehensive dataset that captures the variations in cash usage over time.

To predict critical moments when an ATM's cash balance might reach zero, I employed the Prophet forecasting model, renowned for its accuracy in handling complex time-series data. This AI-driven approach allows us to anticipate cash depletion with high precision, enabling proactive cash replenishment strategies.

The implementation of this predictive model not only minimizes the risk of ATM outages but also optimizes cash logistics, reducing operational costs and enhancing customer satisfaction. This project exemplifies the power of AI in transforming traditional banking operations, ensuring that our ATM network remains resilient, efficient, and customer-focused.
